# MicroDrone
Flight Controller software for brushed drone using ATMega328p (Arduino Nano)

This project was inspired by Jop Brokking and his YMFC-3D series and the code originated from him (big thanks for sharing your code! )
It was however "improved" to fit the atmega328p and fully use the features like PWM timers and so on. 

It for certain is not perfect and needn't to be, because i just like to tinker around and improve the software step by step

If you want to contribute or offer a advice you are welcome :)

If you want to use this code for your project, feel free to but consider it is not well commented and for certain not perfect, it just works for me.
